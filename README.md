videoEncoder
============
Simple videoEncoder around bash and avconv, created around the need to encode HTML5 video.

## Why ?
Encode video can be tricky, I like to wrap-up my preset of avconv in a script,
I needed something simple to encode video and also I can let it run for some
time, with work.

This script is focus to manage the encoding process, add some small features
around that, and that's it, like:

- Make a demo sample (3s).
- Take a screenshot to create a poster.
- Add a watermark, on the video.
- Configure bitrate, size, concurrent threads.
- Output a log.
